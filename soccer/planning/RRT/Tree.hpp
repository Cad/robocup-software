	 * Base tree class for RRT trees.  This class provides the generic data structure
	 * for the tree and the nodes tha make it up and some general algorithms.  Because
	 * many parts of an RRT are implementation-/domain- specific, parts of it should be
	 * placed in callbacks (this is a TODO item for now).
	 * Note: The callbacks used in this class are C++ lambdas.  A good tutorial on them
	 * can be found here: http://www.cprogramming.com/c++11/c++11-lambda-closures.html.
	 *
	 * An RRT tree searches a state space by randomly filling it in and connecting
	 * points to form a branching tree.  Once a branch of the tree reaches the goal and
	 * satisifes all of the constraints, a solution is found and returned.
	 *
	 * The template parameter T is to specify the type that represents a state within
	 * the state-space that the tree is searching.  This could be a Geometry2d::Node or
	 * something else, but will generally be some sort of vector.
